### Contribution Guide: Cookies SDK for Java

Thank you for considering contributions to the Cookies SDK for Java. What follows is a guide for facilitating collaboration:

#### How to build the SDK

The SDK is written in pure Java and built with standard Gradle tooling. There is a custom Maven repository where dependencies can be downloaded in snapshot form, which is listed in the main `build.gradle`. This repository is open for public use.

#### Deploys

Deploys are accomplished via internal CI. We are happy to test contributions and deploy them with an accompanying release.
