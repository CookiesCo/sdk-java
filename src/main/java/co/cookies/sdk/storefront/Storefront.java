/**
 * Defines the API surface for the Java client facade implementing the Cookies Storefront API, which provides business
 * logic for headless cannabis commerce powered by the Cookies Platform.
 *
 * <p>The Storefront API is quite large, and so it is split into functional sub-services which combine on this API
 * interface. Each sub-interface is defined as its own nested block.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instances of the Storefront API Client may be acquired via the {@link CookiesSDK#builder()} method, which can be
 * built into an SDK manager that provides a client via {@link SDKServiceProvider#storefront()}. Customizations can be
 * applied for this service's construction via the methods offered on the builder.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The Cookies Storefront API is a <b>private API service</b> designed for use by Cookies Engineering,
 * partners, contractors, and vendors. To invoke methods on this API, one must provide a valid API key and set of
 * credentials with sufficient authorization scope. <b>Most Storefront API methods require both an API key and a valid
 * user access token.</b></p>
