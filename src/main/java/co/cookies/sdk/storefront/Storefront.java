/**
 * Defines the API surface for the Java client facade implementing the Cookies Storefront API, which provides business
 * logic for headless cannabis commerce powered by the Cookies Platform.
 *
 * <p>The Storefront API is quite large, and so it is split into functional sub-services which combine on this API
 * interface. Each sub-interface is defined as its own nested block.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instances of the Storefront API Client may be acquired via the {@link CookiesSDK#builder()} method, which can be
 * built into an SDK manager that provides a client via {@link SDKServiceProvider#storefront()}. Customizations can be
 * applied for this service's construction via the methods offered on the builder.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The Cookies Storefront API is a <b>private API service</b> designed for use by Cookies Engineering,
 * partners, contractors, and vendors. To invoke methods on this API, one must provide a valid API key and set of
 * credentials with sufficient authorization scope. <b>Most Storefront API methods require both an API key and a valid
 * user access token.</b></p>

    /**
     * Specifies the API surface for the <b>Menu Service</b>, a constituent part of the Cookies Storefront API, which is
     * responsible for traversing catalog and inventory data to produce relevant localized product menus.
     *
     * <p>The Menu API is aware of jurisdictional restrictions and support. For example, CBD products will not be shown
     * in the United States unless an age gate parameter is passed that allows such menu items; additionally, user
     * geo-location occurs to determine relevant retail locations nearby, unless an explicit location is provided.</p>
     *
     * <p>Whereas inventory operates on the individual item level, menus typically operate at the level of <i>abstract
     * products</i>, meaning a single product may have multiple variants, as is the case with item types like apparel
     * and flower (for example, apparel typically has sizes/colors and flower typically is sold at weight-driven size
     * tiers). Via the Menu API, a "product" encompasses all variants and inventory for a given product group.</p>

     * <p>The Profile API works in tandem with Cookies Identity Services, available at `accounts.cookies.co`. After a
     * user authenticates via OAuth or SAML, an access token is yielded which allows them access to view other user
     * profiles (where allowed via privacy settings) and view and edit their own user profile, all via this service.</p>

     *
     * <p>The Checkout API works with the Menu API and Profile API on top of the Cookies Identity platform. Users can be
     * identified or anonymous, but must always carry a valid access token. Checkout for regulated products (shipped CBD
